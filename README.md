rokuLib
=======

Lightweight library for making Roku development easier. Includes math utilities and "classes" for easily creating custom Roku user interfaces.

##Installation

To use this library simply copy the contents of ``rokuLib`` into your source directory.

Using ``rokuLib`` with Eclipse is recommended since Javadocs is partially supported by the Eclipse BrightScript plugin, and the documentation is written with Javadocs.
