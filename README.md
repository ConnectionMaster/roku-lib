rokuLib
=======

Lightweight library for making Roku development easier.

##Installation

To use this library simply copy the contents of ``rokuLib`` into your source directory.

Using ``rokuLib`` with Eclipse is recommended since Javadocs is partially supported by the Eclipse BrightScript plugin, and the documentation is written with Javadocs.

##Utilities

There are math and string utilities that aren't native to the Roku SDK. In addition, I plan to include an image scaler for dealing with PNG files.
