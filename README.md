rokuLib
=======

Lightweight library for making Roku UI development easier. Currently incomplete, but hopefully will have most of the library done by the end of July 2013. Right now this supports loading images, buttons, horizontal/vertical groups, etc.

##Installation

To use this library simply copy the contents of ``rokuLib`` into your source directory.

Using ``rokuLib`` with Eclipse is recommended since Javadocs is partially supported by the Eclipse BrightScript plugin, and the documentation is written with Javadocs.

##Utilities

There are also several math and string utilities that aren't native to the Roku SDK.
